Christian Apologetics

My name is Kris Ashlock.

I am nothing more or less than a sinner saved by grace. God, condescended to me in my sin and changed my life.  I went from hoping on occasion,  if there was a God; He, like a genie might grant me a request or two. Followed by, reluctantly searching for existential answers to life's big questions.  Then, I found Him, well He found me. 

I wanted so badly to maintain the control over my life and my decisions, but I found that at the root of all of my problems there was a mirror looking right back at me. Even if I did not dig deep enough to find it before, in the light of Christ all has been revealed, and the nakedness and exposure I felt brings a new understanding to the purpose behind Adam and Eve using fig leaves to cover themselves from God. Sin. Under the weight of God's perfect law I was exposed, and worst of all I was still focused on me, and how I felt shame. The problem is not shame, exposure, or guilt it is pride. If for a moment we could start looking out instead of looking in, we could finally hear the greatest story ever told. 

I have created this Grid Beta to test the quality of it design, and I have decided to use this as a platform for my message. My mission is evangelism undergirded by apologetics. [For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.][0] I have one goal, and that is to be a beggar showing other hungry beggars where the food is located. I am not here to change minds, only to answer honest questions.

"We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies." ~ Martin Luther King, Jr

We are all sinners, and we are all in need of love.
